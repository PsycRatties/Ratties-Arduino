1- dip training
if green button on, turn on the blue led and relay for x seconds then off for x seconds
var: how long repitions, how many times it cliks (random between limits), limits of randomness x-y, delay of clicking, how much time between each event
this just runs while button is active


2- fixed ratio - COMPLETED


3- variable ratio - COMPLETED
random number of button presses within constraint x-y


4- fixed interval - COMPLETED
press green button, starts program
allow any top button press - if done after any set amount of time, the feeder triggers


5- variable interval
